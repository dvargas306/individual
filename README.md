INFO-494

Hello, I’m Daniel Vargas and I’m a senior Business Informatics major. I was an undergraduate instructor for INFO-360 my junior year after my web development internship the summer before. On a personal note, I’m a senior from Dallas, TX, and I'm studying informatics with a concentration in business. I enjoy spending my free time cycling with friends and teaching Latino dancing choreography throughout the week. I believe a mix of my communication and technology skills would be an asset to this team.
